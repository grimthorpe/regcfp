Update on your Flock submission

Hello,

Thank you for your submission to the Fedora Flock conference.  We had a
great call for participation with strong competition across a variety
of topics.  Unfortunately, we were not able to accept your submission,
"{{paper.title}}".

We hope you will still attend Flock and participate in the various
workshops and hacksessions.

In many cases your submission would make a great submission for
another conference.  We strongly encourage you to consider what other
conferences you could attend to spread the word about Fedora.  Please
contact your local Ambassador for information on how Fedora may be
able to help you with this.

If you submitted multiple talks, you will receive a notification for each
submission separately.

You can find more information about this year's Flock at
https://flocktofedora.org.  The full schedule will be posted there when it
is complete.

Thank you for your submission and we encourage you to try again in the future.

The Flock paper committee
